z80-ports
=========

This utility provides the ability to write to the ports file `.Z80-ports`
used by `z80-mon` to simulate I/O from peripherals.

Start `z80-ports` first to create the ports file, then start `z80-mon` in
another terminal. Outputs to ports in `z80-ports` are reflected in inputs
from ports from instructions in `z80-mon` and vice-versa.

Example usage:
```
$ z80-ports
> out 80,2
OUT 80 => 02
> out 80,2f
OUT 80 => 2f
> in 80
IN 80  <= 2f
> dump
